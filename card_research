# Card Research

Two to four sentences about why you would like one card game over another. 


I have decided I would like to do Blackjack as my card game for the project. I believe that it will be a challenge due
to the dealer not showing what cards they have but also having a value. Also, it seems that it will be challenging to program the dealer on 
when to hit and when to stay.
